Recently I was described as **"pro-AI"**. "Oh, ChatGPT? You should ask Nick about that, he's *pro-AI*."

I was a little taken aback, as "pro-AI" is not how I would ever think to describe my own thoughts and feelings. It's not *wrong* wrong, I guess. I mean, I'm not *anti*-AI in the way that some people are. But still, "pro-AI" is too vague to be useful, and is prone to wild misinterpretation.

*"Okay, so how do you want to be described then?"*

At this point, with respect to AI, I think my position can be summed up as ***optimistic resignationism***.

-   ***Resignationist***: this technology will be *dramatically impactful* in *all sorts of ways*, and its development is *inevitable* and *unstoppable*.

-   ***Optimistic***: along with all of its many negative impacts, there will be *lots of cool and amazing things*, and maybe even the possibility for some *positive social change*.

In short: **It's going to be a bumpy ride to an unknown destination. But the in-flight entertainment will be great.**
