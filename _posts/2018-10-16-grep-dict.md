The English word *balloon* has two consecutive double-letter pairs (*ll* and *oo*). Are there any English words with four consecutive double-letter pairs? This can be a real stumper for someone who doesn't know **regular expressions**. But with regexes, it's easy:

{% highlight shell %}
grep -E '(.)\1(.)\2(.)\3(.)\4' /usr/share/dict/words
{% endhighlight %}

    subbookkeeper

Some explanation about that command:

1.  `grep` is a command that searches stuff. It was named after a similar command in the old `ed` editor, `g/re/p`, for *global regular expression print*.

2.  The `-E` flag tells `grep` to use *extended regular expressions*, which are [strictly more powerful than formal regular expressions](https://nikic.github.io/2012/06/15/The-true-power-of-regular-expressions.html).

3.  `words` is a standard Unix file, though its exact location and contents are not standardized. I'm writing this on an old-ish version of MacOS. Your system may have a different `words` file, and in particular it may have one without the word *subbookkeeper*.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>

4.  The single quotation marks `''` serve to delimit the regex string to be passed to `grep`. Double quotation marks `""` can also be used, but they are probably the wrong choice, since they allow shell evaluation inside.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>

5.  The meat of the command, of course, is the regex `(.)\1(.)\2(.)\3(.)\4`. It consists of three basic parts:
    -   The dot character `.` matches any character at all in a string. If the `words` file contained numbers and punctuation and other junk, this would be a bad choice, and something more specific would be needed.
    -   The parentheses `()` group whatever is inside them. A grouped match can be referenced later.
    -   The backslash-numbers `\1` etc are *backreferences*. This is how grouped matches can be referred back to. The nth backreference refers to the nth match (with the numbering typically being 1-indexed).

I like to **grep dictionaries** for different patterns. For instance, here's one to search for words with **palindromic substrings** of length eight or nine:

{% highlight shell %}
grep -E '(.)(.)(.)(.).?\4\3\2\1' /usr/share/dict/words
{% endhighlight %}

This yields some good ones, like *sensuousness*, *leviative*, and *overappareled*. Note the presence of the question mark `?` in that regex: it means that the preceding match can occur once or not at all. This is needed because `abcba` and `abba` are equally palindromic.

That search can be modified to yield **strict palindromes** by adding the caret `^` and dollar sign `$`, which respectively match to the beginning and end of a string. Wrapping a regex in `^$` will match only whole strings, not substrings.

{% highlight shell %}
grep -E '^(.)(.)(.).?\3\2\1$' /usr/share/dict/words
{% endhighlight %}

This gives words like *reviver*, *rotator*, and my favorite, *repaper*.

As a challenge, consider the following search:

{% highlight shell %}
grep -E "(.).\1..\1...\1....\1" /usr/share/dict/words
{% endhighlight %}

How would you characterize that regex in plain language? Can you think of a match?

But enough about English. It's also fun to grep other languages for strange patterns. Let's take **Turkish**, for example. First, we need to get a Turkish word list. One way to do this is:

{% highlight shell %}
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mertemin/turkish-word-list/master/words.txt --silent | grep -v '[ ]' > ~/turkish-words
{% endhighlight %}

Let's try the search we started with, looking for words with four consecutive double-letter pairs.

{% highlight shell %}
grep -E '(.)\1(.)\2(.)\3(.)\4' ~/turkish-words
{% endhighlight %}

    maatteessüf

This is an archaic Turkish word meaning *unfortunately*. A commonly-used variant is *maalesef*. Both are ultimately derived from the **Arabic** word *asef* اسف, meaning *regret* or something like that.

How about palindromes? It turns out that Turkish actually has a full nine-letter proper palindrome:

{% highlight shell %}
grep -E '(.)(.)(.)(.).?\4\3\2\1' ~/turkish-words
{% endhighlight %}

    kamalamak

The word *kama* means *dagger*, and *-mak* is a verbal infinitive suffix, so *kamalamak* is a verb meaning *to stab with a dagger*, or even just *to dagger* if you want to use *dagger* as a verb.

Another fun application is finding what I call ***Turkish keyboard words***. A [typical Turkish keyboard](http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/rr25/Turkishwin/turkish-q.jpg) looks a lot like an American QWERTY keyboard, except that it has six extra letters added to the right of *m l p*: *ö ç ş i ğ ü*.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> I like to try and think of words and phrases that can be written using only these letter (along with spaces). Finding such words is easy with regexes.

{% highlight shell %}
grep -E '^[öçşiğü]+$' ~/turkish-words
{% endhighlight %}

    çiğ
    çiş
    çüş
    iç
    içiş
    iğ
    iş
    işçi
    öç
    şiş
    üç

These words can be shuffled around to make funny phrases like *üç öç iği*, *three revenge spindles*, and *çiğ işçi çişi*, *raw worker piss*.

Now let's take a look at some **Georgian** words. Again, we'll need a word list first.

{% highlight shell %}
curl http://crubadan.org/files/ka.zip --silent -o ~/ka.zip && unzip ~/ka.zip -d ~/ka-crubadan && awk '!/-/ { print $1 }' ~/ka-crubadan/ka-words.txt | LC_ALL=C sort -d > ~/georgian-words
{% endhighlight %}

Georgian is infamous for its **difficult consonant clusters**. The Georgian vowels are *ა ე ი ო უ* (*a e i o u*), so let's try grepping for words with sequences not containing those letters. To do this, we'll use bracket-caret notation: `[^a]`, for example, matches characters other than `a`. For convenience, we'll also use brace counting: `a{5}` matches five `a`'s in a row.

{% highlight shell %}
grep -E '[^აეიოუ]{6}' ~/georgian-words
{% endhighlight %}

     მწვრთნელ
     მწვრთნელად
     მწვრთნელების
     მწვრთნელებს
     მწვრთნელთა
     მწვრთნელთან
     მწვრთნელი
     მწვრთნელის
     მწვრთნელმა
     მწვრთნელობის
     მწვრთნელს
     სამწვრთნელო
     შორსმჭვრეტელი

The first eleven words in that list are obvious variations of მწვრთნელი *trainer, coach*. <sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> Transliterated into English, this word looks like *mtsvrtneli* (with the single letter წ transliterated as *ts*). To say the least, it's not an easy word to say.

The only word in that list that isn't a variation of მწვრთნელი is შორსმჭვრეტელი *seer* (I think). The regex matched this word on the substring რსმჭვრ *rsmchvr*. This is actually a compound word &#x2013; შორს *far* and მჭვრეტელი *watcher* &#x2013; so in a linguistic sense this probably doesn't count as a true consonant cluster. But this isn't a post about linguistics, it's a post about grepping.

Finally, consider the Georgian letter **ყ**. This letter stands for a sound that is very foreign to English, a pop from the back of the throat. It corresponds to the Arabic ق. A word that Georgians often trot out to mock the pronunciation of foreginers is ბაყაყი *frog*. This has two ყ's in close proximity, and it's hard to get it right. Curiously, this word is of Turkic origin, and variations are used all over the place &#x2013; Sorani Kurdish, for instance, has بۆق.

Anyway, are there any other Georgian words with ყ's near each other?

{% highlight shell %}
grep -E 'ყ.?ყ' ~/georgian-words
{% endhighlight %}

     ბაყაყები
     ბაყაყების
     ბაყაყი
     უყოყმანოდ
     ყაყაჩო
     ყაყაჩოს
     ყოყმანის
     ყოყმანობდა

Excluding variations, it looks like there are just two other words with this pattern: ყაყაჩო *poppy* and ყოყმანი *hesitation*. They are also hard to say.

# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Is a `words` file (or a dictionary in general) better or worse for having a somewhat artificial word like *subbookkeeper*? If your `words` file doesn't have this word, do you wish it did?

<sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> On my computer, the command `grep "$USER$" /usr/share/dict/words` yields words like *picknick*. Can you guess what my username is?

<sup><a id="fn.3" href="#fnr.3">3</a></sup> The usual *i* key is actually replaced with the Turkish dotless *ı*, so that when Turkısh people wrıte emaıls ın Englısh, ıt sometımes looks lıke thıs.

<sup><a id="fn.4" href="#fnr.4">4</a></sup> The twelfth word, სამწვრთნელო, is a non-obvious variation: სა-მწვრთნელ-ო. I think it means *gym* or *training facility*.
